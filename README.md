📘 Introduction

The electric vehicle (EV) industry is undergoing rapid transformation driven by sustainability goals, technological advancements, and government incentives. Understanding EV adoption patterns, market composition, and performance metrics is essential for policymakers, automotive manufacturers, and strategic decision-makers.
This Tableau project analyzes electric vehicle data to provide a clear, structured, and insight-driven view of the EV market, covering both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The dashboard is designed to support business and policy decisions through intuitive visual storytelling.

🎯 Problem Statement

As the EV market expands, stakeholders face challenges in understanding:
